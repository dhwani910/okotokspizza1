            Pizza is sold fresh or frozen,
             and whole or as portion-size slices or pieces.
              Methods have been developed to overcome challenges 
              such as preventing the sauce from combining with 
              the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen 
              and reheated without becoming rigid. There are 
              frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising
               crusts.
        </p>

            Another form of uncooked pizza is available
             from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is
              assembled in the store, then sold to customers 
              to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores
               sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic
                ingredients, to complete at home before baking
                 in an oven.
